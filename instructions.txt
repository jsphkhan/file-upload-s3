This is a React App that uploads file to a S3 Bucket using S3 SDK

To use AWS services install the "aws-sdk" NPM package

This is not an Ejected App

How to run
------------------
1. To run the app - create a production build
npm run build

2. And then start Node server: node server.js

3. Or use Docker to run


How it works
---------------
React app uploads file to Node server -> Node server uploads to S3

React app runs at localhost:8081 (production build)
React app makes POST call to /upload
Node server handles POST call and uploads to S3


Better technique
------------------
Since we are uploading the file first to Node and Node uploads to S3
So the Node server is consuming resources.
Rather directly upload files to S3 from client.
